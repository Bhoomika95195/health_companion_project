## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

You will need the following software installed on your computer:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (if running locally) or a MongoDB Atlas account.

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend Server**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file and add your variables (see .env.example)
    cp .env.example .env

    # Start the server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend Client**
    ```sh
    # Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory
    cd client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file (see .env.example)
    cp .env.example .env

    # Start the client
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

### **Environment Variables**

You will need to create `.env` files in both the `/server` and `/client` directories.

**`/server/.env`**
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

**`/client/.env`**
## üîÆ Future Enhancements
